Welcome to the FocusNinja App! This app is a desktop time management tool that helps you stay productive by breaking your work into intervals,
typically 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. This technique is known as the Pomodoro Technique. The app provides you with a 
timer to manage your work and break intervals, keeping you on track and focused.

Features

Customizable Timers: Set custom work and break durations to fit your preferences.
Notifications: Get alerted when it's time to work or take a break.
Mouse 'Kidnapper': Seeing yourself getting sidetracked during breaks? Be it watching a short movie or reading an article or playing a game 
(a short game can easily drag to an hour). This feature locks your mouse in a single position during breaks, so you can avoid these distractions.
(just delete lines 50, 59, 152, 188, and 211 from ButtonFunctions.class if you dont want this feature, might add a tickbox to enable/disable this feature in the future)
